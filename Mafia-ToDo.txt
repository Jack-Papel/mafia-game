Thomas thing
---------

//IMPOSTER -- You blackmail someone for a day and you can talk under their name, 3 uses
//GRAVESTEALER -- Like Janitor, but instead of cleaning, it doesnt show that their dead... all day, every day, until they are voted up.... 
        AKA, theyre blackmailed and roleblocked every day until voted up. And they can talk in dead chat
//PARALYZER -- You pick someone, and it shows that they died,, even though they didnt, they are blackmailed for the day to make it convincing.
        This has the side effect of confirming their role, so its a big risk. However if you have a Janitor/Forger then it could be really cool
//KIDNAPPER -- evil jailor
//JOURNALIST -- can write in a journal and anonymously post to town every morning
//LEEROY JENKINS -- You pick someone during the day and they die instantly revealing your name to everyone
        i reveal as mayor /// NO YOU DONT!
// --Hides what everyone is voting for and gives themself 3x vote
//Jounralist
